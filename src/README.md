# Traffic Light Simulation in C

## üü¢ Overview

This is a simple Traffic Light Simulation Program written in C.
It demonstrates the basic functioning of a traffic light system by sequentially displaying the lights ‚Äî RED, YELLOW, and GREEN ‚Äî with timed delays between each signal.

The project uses the Windows API Sleep() function to create pauses between transitions, providing a clear visual simulation directly in the terminal.

## Features

- Simulates any number of traffic light cycles as entered by the user.

- Allows users to continue or stop the simulation interactively.

- Uses delays to represent real-time light changes.

- Simple and beginner-friendly code structure.

## How It Works

1. The program greets the user and asks how many cycles to simulate.

2. Each cycle displays:

- RED light for 1 second
- YELLOW light for 1 second
- GREEN light for 1 second

3. After completing the entered number of cycles, the user is asked if they want to continue the simulation.

4. Typing:

- y ‚Üí runs another simulation
- n ‚Üí ends the program

## Example Output

```bash
Traffic Light Program Starting Now!
Enter -1 to quit:
how many traffic light cycles do you want to simulate? 3

RED
YELLOW
GREEN

RED
YELLOW
GREEN

RED
YELLOW
GREEN

Do you want to continue simulation? (y/n) y
how many traffic light cycles do you want to simulate? 2
```

## Requirements

- Operating System: Windows (because the code uses Sleep() from windows.h)
- Compiler: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or MSVC)

## Compilation and Execution

### Using GCC (MinGW) on Windows

```bash
gcc traffic_light.c -o traffic_light.exe
traffic_light.exe
```

## Code Explanation

- #include <windows.h> ‚Äì Provides the Sleep() function to create delays.

- #include <string.h> ‚Äì Used for case-insensitive string comparison with \_stricmp().

- The while loop runs the simulation until the user enters -1 or chooses not to continue.

- Each traffic light phase is separated by a one-second delay.

## Future Improvements

- Add color-coded text output for each light (e.g., red, yellow, green).
- Make it cross-platform using standard timing libraries (unistd.h on Linux).
- Implement graphical output using a GUI library like SDL or OpenGL.
